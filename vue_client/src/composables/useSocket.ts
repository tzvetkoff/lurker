 * flip. Nor does the remount re-ingest anything, because the buffer already has messages. The net
 * effect was that turning the setting on in the settings UI left every existing message without a
 * preview, forever — the exact outcome the watcher was written to prevent. It only ever worked
 * via `/set` and cross-device sync, which is why it survived QA.
 *
 * Every loaded buffer, not just the active one: `MessageList` is not keyed per buffer, so
 * priming only what happens to be on screen left every other buffer blank for the session.
 *
 * Still called lazily rather than at module load: it reads Pinia stores, which do not exist until
 * the app has installed Pinia.
